# MERN Stack App with JWT Authentication

## Project Description

This project is a full-stack web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. It demonstrates the implementation of JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication for user sessions. Users can securely sign up, log in, and access protected resources using JWTs.

For a detailed guide on the implementation of access tokens and refreshing tokens in this project, please refer to the following blog post:
